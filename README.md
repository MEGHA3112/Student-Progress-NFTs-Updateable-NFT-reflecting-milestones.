# Student Progress NFTs – Updateable NFT Reflecting Milestones

## 🏷️ Project Title
**Student Progress NFTs – Updateable NFT Reflecting Milestones**

## 📖 Project Description
This smart contract, written in Clarity for the Stacks blockchain, enables minting and updating of NFTs that represent individual students. Each NFT stores a "milestone" (e.g., "Completed Semester 1", "Passed Final Exam"), allowing the NFT to reflect academic progress over time.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To tokenize academic achievements in a verifiable and transparent way. Each NFT acts as a digital progress card for students, owned and controlled by them, and updateable as they complete new milestones.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with a frontend dashboard for institutions and students
- Admin roles for educators to verify and update student milestones
- Support for metadata standards (e.g., SIP-009 compliant metadata)
- On-chain verification of milestone criteria
- Integration with badges or achievements systems
